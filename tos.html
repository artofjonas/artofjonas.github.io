        <h1>Jonas's Terms of Service</h1> <!-- add anchor links -->       
        <h2>Payment</h2>
            <p>If we're negotiating a commission through a service like Artconomy, they will handle payment collection. If we're negotiating directly, I will need your e-mail to send you an electronic invoice.  The terms of payment will be adjusted based on the commission price.</p>
            <p>Full payment is required up-front for small works (anything under $200).  Payment is expected within 48 hours of my confirmation that I have accepted your commission. After 48 hours without payment or contact, I will consider the commission slot abandoned and remove it from my queue. If payment needs to be delayed/split for any reason, I'm willing to work with you, but you need to let me know in advance.</p>
            <p>Complex character designs will incur a 25% markup on the base fee. Complex character designs are including, but not limited to, the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Detailed tattoos that wrap around limbs</li>
                    <li>Intricate and/or irregular fur patterns that can't be easily tessellated</li>
                    <li>Small-scale details that aren't readily noticed at first glance</li>
                    <li>Complex color schemes and/or multiple gradients</li>
                    <li>Anything else that involves substantial time costs to render</li>
                </ul>
        
        <h2>Refunds</h2> <!-- add partial refund clause -->
        <p>No refunds will be given after I have completed the work.</p>

        <h2>Time Frame</h2>
            <p>All my commissions are <b>OPEN-ENDED (no due date)</b> unless a deadline has been arranged with me <b>in advance</b>. To request a deadline, you <b>MUST</b> notify me in your first communication about the project along with an exact due date. Please keep in mind that it is your responsibility to respond to my messages/drafts in a timely manner when your piece is on a deadline.</p>
            <p>Please be aware that I may work on projects “out of order,” depending on multiple factors (complexity, rush jobs, etc.). This means commissions  will not always be completed or posted in the exact order in which they were received.</p>
            <p>Rush Jobs: if you have an urgent deadline (in 2 weeks or less) I am sometimes willing to do priority rush jobs. However, this is not always possible, and if it is, there will be an extra rush fee added to the base cost of the commission.</p>

        <h2>Subject Matter</h2> <!-- add detailed no list -->
            <p>I will not draw depictions of extreme fetishes, extreme violence, or hateful imagery. Otherwise, I will consider adult requests on a case-by-case basis. If you're uncertain, please ask me via email or private message. I reserve the right to refuse commissions containing content I am uncomfortable with, regardless of whether or not I've drawn it before (or anything similar to it).</p>
        
        <h2>Reference</h2>
            <p>I require visual reference for all characters, clothing and props depicted in your commission. I cannot work from text descriptions alone. The only exception I will make to this rule is for character model sheets.</p>
            <p>Generic visual references (e.g. relevant photos found online) are also very helpful and encouraged, especially for more obscure species, patterns/coloration, items of a certain size/brand/design, specific costumes, armor, props, period items, etc. </p>
        
        <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>If a character you want in a commission is owned by someone other than you, you <b>MUST</b> be prepared to obtain &#8211; and show me &#8211; explicit authorization from the creator for their character to be used in this manner.</p>
            <p>The <b>only</b> exception to the above rule is if it's a surprise gift for the character's owner; I will go case-by-case on this, but if you can demonstrate a reasonable relationship where use of another's character is generally acceptable (e.g. personal friends, mates), this is probably OK.</p>
        
        <h2>Work Process</h2>
            <p>I will provide periodic work-in-progress drafts as the commission progresses.</p>
            <p> When specifying revisions, please try to be as <b>specific</b> and <b>comprehensive</b> as possible about what you would like changed, at the earliest possible stage. Errors are most fixable in the sketch stage; be aware I may not be able to make certain kinds of changes at later stages as they will involve more substantial backtracking than earlier stages.</p>
            <p><b>If I have to make revisions beyond the agreed quantity, I will have to charge you extra.</b></p>
        
        <h2>Posting and Reposting</h2>
            <h3>Commissioner Privacy</h3>
                <p>
                    Please let me know in advance if:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You want a commission to be completely private (i.e. never posted on any galleries, social media, etc)</li>
                        <li>You want me to tag you with a specific handle/username/alias.</li>
                        <li>You want me to list you as anonymous.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <h3>Reposting</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm generally not opposed to seeing my work reposted in chats and on social media and galleries like FurAffinity, under the following conditions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The work must remain whole and unaltered</li>
                        <li>I must be credited for it</li>
                        <li>If it's anything NSFW, or something I did privately for you, please <b>ASK ME FIRST</b>. (I just want to keep track of where my work ends up.)</li>
                        <li>It isn't anywhere where I'm on a Do Not Post list.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>You may freely repost your own icon commissions &#8211; or crop your larger commissions for use as icons &#8211; with or without credit, but credit is always appreciated if there's room for it.</p>

        <h2>AI</h2>
            <p>I do not consent to anyone using I have created to train artificial intelligence models. I do not consent to anyone altering my art with artificial intelligence models. I reserve the right to decline to work with anyone who does not respect these decisions.</p>
        
        <h2>Shipment</h2>
            <p>For traditional commissions where a real-media product exists, the following applies:</p>
            <h3>Shipping Fees</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Shipping costs extra, and is <b>not</b> included in my base prices.</li>
                        <li>I estimate costs and ship via USPS by default. You may request extra services (Insurance, Priority, Confirmation, etc.) or other carriers where available (UPS, Fedex) but the cost will be accordingly higher.</li>
                        <li>I will provide a tracking number once the piece is shipped.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <h3>Packaging</h3>
                <p>I always do my best to package artwork discreetly and securely, with sufficient padding to withstand typical shipment stresses.</p>
            <h3>Addresses</h3>
                <p>I need a complete, correctly formatted mailing address to ship to, including a ZIP code/postcode. I strongly recommend that prospective clients in the U.S. verify their address formatting via <a href="https://tools.usps.com/zip-code-lookup.htm" target="_blank">USPS's ZIP code lookup tool</a>. Please note that for United States Post Office boxes, I can only ship USPS.</p>
            <h3>Insurance</h3>
                <p>I will <b>ONLY</b> assume financial responsibility for lost/damaged mail that has been insured! While this is an unlikely occurrence, if you are worried about the possibility, please request insurance for your package. Otherwise, once it is out of my hands I am not responsible for the carrier's handling of the package, unforeseen delays, or acts of God that might impede, delay or prevent delivery of the package to its intended destination.</p>
            <h3>International Shipping</h3>
                <p>I am usually willing to ship internationally (outside the United States) at cost, however several special rules apply:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The client pays all duties, tariffs and fees applicable to international shipments to their country.</li>
                        <li>The artist will not ship any art containing content prohibited by the laws of the client's country.</li>
                        <li>The address you provide must be complete and conform to the standard address formats of your country/territory/region.</li>
                        <li>In the event that you need work shipped internationally in time for a specific deadline (e.g. a badge for a convention), I NEED at least 30 days' lead time to account for revisions, international shipments, and the possibility of Customs delays or other delays.  Rush charges will be added if I have to ship something internationally by fast courier services such as DHL.</li>
                        <li>If any of the above is a concern, <b>PLEASE</b> discuss it with me before we start the commission.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

        <h2>Special Offers</h2>
                <p>On occasion, I may offer special types of commissions. These special offers may in some cases have different or more limited rules regarding things like payment, timeframe, shipping, etc. In these cases, I will outline the exact rules in the specific offer, and those rules will for that instance supersede any that conflict with this ToS.</p>

        <h2>Contacting Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I will need a reliable e-mail address in the event that I need to get in touch with you and other services are unavailable.
                    Please <b>DO NOT</b> send any commission-related questions through public channels (e.g. FA shouts/comments, stream chats, social media DMs, Discord channels, etc). Such comments will be ignored and/or deleted, and if this rule is repeatedly broken I will cancel and refund your commission.
                </p>
